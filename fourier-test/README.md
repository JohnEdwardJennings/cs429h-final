This directory contains two files used for white-box testing and tinkering with parameters of the Fourier transform predictor: 
* fourier-test: white-box testing code; prints the final amplitudes at each frequency as well as the prediction pattern and overall accuracy
* double-fourier-test: similar to fourier-test, but works with a combined cosine and sine Fourier series (fourier-test works with only a cosine series)

It also contains a variant of the main IPC1 script that specifically runs the Fourier transform predictor.
